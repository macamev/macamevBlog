      <description>FrogCanJump is a 2D doodle jump inspired platformer arcade game. It&amp;rsquo;s not yet finished and is currently still in development.
I&amp;rsquo;m continuing work on the game as I still see a lot of potential features and juice that can be added. So far the very basics are implemented that makes this in to a game. The player can jump and score is kept, best highscore is stored to add an extra challenge of beating ones own score.</description>

      <description>This project is a 2D game created with the Godot game engine. The game is a remake of the old classic pajatso gambling game. The player&amp;rsquo;s goal is to shoot coins in to boxes to score. You can adjust the strength of the shot by following the bar progress. You&amp;rsquo;re able to get more coins by when the timer is done counting down. Once the timer is done press the get more coins button.</description>
